Hey gorgeous!👊

Yes, you right there!

Your face  😍is an incredible thing that you possess. From granting you an unique identity to bringing out your charisma😎 to share with the world,
the human face holds a lot of information.

If we recollect certain scenarios how:

Face recognition technology holds immense promise for a lot of applications and with time it just gets better.
From the giants like Google, Facebook to formidible startups, this field is constantly being enriched by contributions.

Wondering🤔🤔, if you could build the spell behind Apple's FaceID🤑 or perhaps even something better?

But where, to start from..? 🔍

Well, Python🐍 has your back for this as you craft your first script that detects a face to your attempt to reach the state-of-the-art⚡

In this series, **SmilePlease** I shall show you some of the ways that you can get started.

- Make sure you have the lastest version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) installed on your system and its set to path
- Clone this repository ⏬
- Move inside 👉 the repo 
    - Open the Terminal 👩‍💻
    - and type ```cd smileplease```

This is gonna be the ```hello world``` of your face recognition journey

Here,we create a simple script that takes in an input image and detects faces in it

#### Lets see a demo:

- Put your image inside the directory ```input_images``` or get its path
- Run the script ```smileplease_1.py```
    - Open the Terminal 👩‍💻
    - and type ```python smile_1.py -i <path to your input image>``` 
- Press ``q``` to quit
- The result was saved in ```/output_images/face_recognized.png```

#### Results:

|Input|Ouput|
|-----|-----|

Building on our previous knowledge, here we see how to create a simple script that detects faces in an input video and even in real time from our web cam

#### Lets see a demo:

###### If you want to see face detection in a given video

- Put your video inside the directory ```input_videos``` or get its path
- Run the script ```smileplease_2.py```
    - Open the Terminal 👩‍💻
    - and type ```python smile_2.py -v <path to your input video>``` 
- Press ```q``` to quit

###### If you want to see face detection in real time from your  web cam  

- Run the script ```smileplease_2.py```
    - Open the Terminal 👩‍💻
    - and type ```python smile_2.py``` 
- Press ```q``` to quit

## SmilePlease03:

Lets take our face detection performance to the next level by leveraging the power of deep learning.

#### Lets see a demo:

- Put your image inside the directory ```input_images``` or get its path
- Run the script ```smileplease_3.py```
    - Open the Terminal 👩‍💻
    - and type ```python smile_3.py -i <path to your input image>``` 
- Press ``q``` to quit
- The result was saved in ```/output_images/face_recognized_3.png```

#### Results:
